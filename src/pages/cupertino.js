				in june 2019, my dad and i travelled to san jose / cupertino (? i really don't know how the south bay area works
				geographically, lol). i was attending an apple conference, and i don't remember why exactly my dad wanted to go,
				but he ended up getting an airbnb in cupertino and exploring local restaurants, libraries, and the apple visitor
				center that week. he started his days early in the morning, eating oatmeal & watching the neighbors drive to work
				in their teslas, then spent hours wandering (on foot and bus).<br /><br />
				afterwards, when he was recounting all the places he'd visited and the things he'd done, one remark stood out
				to me: he told me he felt like the only relaxed person in the entire city. i found this feeling of being out
				of step with the rest of one's world really intriguing (and relatable); it reminded me of a quote from a piece i read
				a few months ago for a (later-dropped) literature & urban studies class, about the ways a "labyrinth" is
				different from a "maze": "...the intentional traveler, wrapped up in the space of [their] own deliberations, is,
				by the same token, absent from the world itself...to [traverse a labyrinth], [one's] action must be closely and
				continually coupled with [one's] perception &#8211; that is, by an ever-vigilant monitoring of the path as it unfolds.
				simply put, you have to watch your step, and to listen and feel as well. path-following, in short, is not so much
				intentional as attentional. it draws the follower out into the presence of the real." (ingold, "the maze and the labyrinth:
				walking, imagining and the education of attention.")<br /><br />
				overall, i think this is a pretty interesting case study, since it's quite rare (and takes privilege, for sure)
				to get the opportunity to absorb a city like cupertino from a purely observational perspective &#8211; as a labyrinth,
				rather than a maze.<br /><br /><br /><br />
				(these ramblings don't even qualify as half-baked, lmao)
